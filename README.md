# lorebot-rewritten
this is the shoddily rewritten version of hullseals lorebot. i felt like yandev making this because its been like four fucking years since ive done anything relating to python so
its done so shit because the bot that lorebot was originally based on used a funky text file to easily create and store command responses and i cant do any of that shit. 

## ***SOME COMMANDS ARE EXCLUDED.***
excluded commands include those that were used a handful of times. ur favourites should still exist.



check the bot token in the main.py file it might be mine woopsie ðŸ¤­


bot, as of 15th of june 2024, uses original discord links to store media. this will in future be changed to a more reliable service, like catbox or lain.la .
so pls dont delete anything in discord ever or else this bot will never work again.
